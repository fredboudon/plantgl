    Compute a projection matrix that transforms vectors from world coordinates to a local coordinate system.

    The matrix transforms vectors so that the 'forward' direction becomes the Z axis, and the 'up' direction

    Parameters
    ----------
    forward : pgl.Vector3
        The forward direction vector that will become the Z axis in the new coordinate system.
        Will be normalized during computation.
    up : pgl.Vector3, optional
        The approximate up direction vector, by default (0,0,1).

  Return the timezone identifier for a given geographic coordinate.

  This function is a thin wrapper around tzfpy.get_tz and returns whatever
  identifier tzfpy provides for the location (for example 'Europe/Paris').

  Args:
    latitude (float): Latitude in decimal degrees. Positive values indicate north;
      expected range is -90.0 to 90.0.
    longitude (float): Longitude in decimal degrees. Positive values indicate east;
      expected range is -180.0 to 180.0.

  Returns:
    str or None: Timezone identifier string as returned by tzfpy.get_tz, or None
    if no timezone could be determined for the given coordinates.

  Raises:
    Propagates exceptions raised by tzfpy.get_tz (for example, if tzfpy is not
    installed or an internal error occurs).

  Notes:
    - Ensure the tzfpy package is available in the environment where this
      function is called.
    - No validation beyond documenting expected ranges is performed here;
      callers should validate coordinates if needed.
